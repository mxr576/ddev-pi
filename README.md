# DDEV add-on for Pi Coding Agent

This DDEV add-on provides a fully containerized, isolated environment for the [Pi Coding Agent](https://pi.dev).

## Architecture & security

- **Full isolation:** The agent runs in a dedicated sidecar container. The host machine's `~/.pi` directory is explicitly *not* mounted, so agent state is scoped strictly to the project and avoids cross-contamination with your host environment.
- **Project access:** The project root is mounted at `/var/www/html` with read/write permissions, allowing Pi to interact with your codebase.
- **Network:** The agent is isolated within the DDEV project network.
- **Sensitive data:** No host-level sensitive directories (e.g., `~/.ssh`) are mounted.
- **Offline by default:** Network-dependent features (`PI_OFFLINE=1`, `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1`, `PI_TELEMETRY=0`) are disabled by default to keep the container self-contained and avoid unexpected outbound traffic.

For a detailed diagram and breakdown of the system's components and security boundaries, please see the [Architecture document](docs/architecture.md).

> [!WARNING]
> While process isolation is provided by the container, running coding agents on a local read-write workspace carries inherent security risks (such as prompt injection, credential leaks and host-execution escapes). Please see the [Security Advisory](docs/SECURITY.md) to understand these risks and learn how to harden your setup.

## Requirements

- DDEV >= v1.25.2
- The [`trebormc/ddev-ai-ssh`](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-ai-ssh) add-on (installed automatically as a dependency)

## Installation

```bash
ddev add-on get mxr576/ddev-pi
ddev restart
```

## Usage

The Pi agent runs as a DDEV service under the `pi` profile. You must start DDEV with that profile active.

1. Start DDEV with the Pi profile enabled:
   ```bash
   ddev start --profiles=pi
   ```
2. Run Pi commands via the `ddev pi` wrapper:
   ```bash
   ddev pi [command]
   ```

Example:

```bash
ddev pi status
```

> **Note:** The `ddev pi` command is a thin wrapper that runs `ddev exec --service=pi pi "$@"` inside the sidecar container. The container's working directory is `/var/www/html` (your project root).

## Configuration

Default configurations are initialized in your project's `.pi/` directory during installation (`settings.json` is copied from the add-on defaults). Modify `settings.json` there to configure providers and agent preferences.

> **Note:** Re-running `ddev add-on get` will not overwrite an existing `.pi/` directory. Defaults are only copied when `.pi/` is empty.

## Extensibility

This add-on provides several ways to customize the container environment and manage Pi extensions. For detailed information, please see the [Extensibility document](docs/extensions.md).


## Uninstalling

```bash
ddev addon remove pi
```

The `.pi/` folder in your project root and the `pi-agent` Docker volume are **not** removed automatically. Clean them up manually if needed:

```bash
# Remove the project Pi configuration
rm -rf .pi/

# Remove the named Docker volume
docker volume rm ddev-<your-project-name>-pi-agent
```
